# About

This is a repo to showcase how to implement different CVI components when building BÃ¼rokratt.

In order to run it via docker, froom root directory run command 'docker-compose up -d'
In order to run project as react app, run 'npm install --legacy-peer-deps' followed by 'npm run dev'

# Creating package

To create npm package for header:
* navitage to : src > exportcomponents
* run 'npm pack' command to create package locally

To publish npm package:
* run 'npm publish --access public'
* Authorize in npm and package would be published
  * If you want to use local package, put created package to the root of react app and add depenency like "@exirain/header": "file:exirain-header-0.0.5.tgz" (use proper version)

To USE header package
* in order for header package to work you need to do some steps
  * in main.tsx/index.tsx 
    * Use imprort and import mockApi to mock apis or make sure all data is being fetched
    * If data is being mocked by provided mock api make sure to import * as mock from header package and use it
  * Make sure that App.tsx fetches initial user info and stores it in store that provided by application
  * In layout component you need to provide userState to the header component <Header user={useUserInfoStore.getState()}/>

Implemented header with examples could be found in:
* https://github.com/buerokratt/Training-Module
* https://github.com/buerokratt/Service-Module

### Short description

This is sample solution developers can take as base for the new applications.
The solution has common base layout created and example main navigation added.
Also two very simple example pages are included.

### Components from CVI

The solution uses styles (https://github.com/buerokratt/cvi/tree/main/libs/styles/src/lib)
and components (https://github.com/buerokratt/cvi/tree/main/libs/react-ui/src/lib) from CVI.
From components are used icons and main-navigation. All styles are directly copied to solution.

### Next steps

As main-navigation menu items parameter is currently hardcoded, probably some (network) services must be created.
The layout component needs to be updated to use the services.
(Read the comments in layout and main-navigation components code)
Router routes (in correlation with main-navigation items) must be defined/updated to load correct pages.
